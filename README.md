# Tenshoku DRAFT RubyKaigi Special Codes

## Introduction

This repository contains two special Ruby codes:
1. **Ruby Logo Quine**: A quine code that outputs the Ruby logo.
2. **Tenshoku DRAFT Class in Ruby**: A Ruby class definition representing the "転職ドラフト" service.

These codes were featured at our booth during the RubyKaigi conference as part of a raffle draw. The top raffle prize included tote bags adorned with these codes.

## Contents

- `ruby_logo_quine.rb`: A modified quine that generates the Ruby logo when executed.
- `tenshoku_draft.rb`: A Ruby class that encapsulates functionalities of the 転職ドラフト service.


## Usage

### Ruby Logo Quine

To run the Ruby logo quine, execute the following command in your Ruby environment:

```bash
ruby ruby_logo_quine.rb
```

This will print the Ruby logo to your terminal.

To display the Ruby logo with color, use the `--color` option:

```bash
ruby ruby_logo_quine.rb --color
```
